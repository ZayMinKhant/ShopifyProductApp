## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- A Shopify Partner account
- A Shopify development store
- Git installed on your machine

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZayMinKhant/ShopifyProductApp.git
cd ShopifyProductApp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
SCOPES=read_products,write_products
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
```

### 4. Shopify App Configuration
Edit `shopify.app.toml` to match your appâ€™s URL and credentials.

> **Note:** If you want to test the app in development, you may need to update `shopify.app.toml` to reflect your local tunnel (e.g., ngrok) or dev server URL, and ensure the allowed redirect URLs match your development environment. This is required for Shopify to correctly redirect and embed your app during local testing. You can update 'automatically_update_urls_on_dev = false' to 'true' easily.

### 5. Database Setup (Prisma)
```bash
npm run setup
```

### 6. Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```
