## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18 or higher
- A Shopify Partner account
- A Shopify development store
- Git installed on your machine

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZayMinKhant/ShopifyProductApp.git
cd ShopifyProductApp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
SCOPES=read_products,write_products
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
```

## Dynamic Shop Domain

**Note:** The app now reads the shop domain dynamically from the URL query string. To use the app for a specific shop, include the `shop` parameter in the URL, for example:

```
https://your-app.onrender.com/app?shop=myshopdomain
```

- The `shop` value will be used to generate Shopify admin links and for shop-specific logic in the frontend.
- The environment variable `VITE_SHOP_DOMAIN` is no longer used in the frontend code for determining the shop domain.
